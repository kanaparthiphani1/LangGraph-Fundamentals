# 📘 LangGraph Fundamentals – My Learning Journey

Welcome to my **LangGraph Fundamentals** learning repo!  
This space is dedicated to exploring the concepts, patterns, and hands-on implementations of **LangGraph**, a framework for building stateful, multi-agent, and workflow-driven LLM applications.

---

## 🔍 What is LangGraph?
[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) is a framework built on top of **LangChain**, designed to make it easier to create:
- ✅ **Agentic workflows** (agents + tools + control flow)  
- ✅ **Graphs of computation** with cycles, branches, and memory  
- ✅ **Persistent & resumable state machines** for LLM-driven apps  

It’s especially useful for **multi-turn, stateful, and structured** applications where simple prompts aren’t enough.

## 📚 Learning Goals
In this repo, I’ll document:
1. **Core Concepts**
   - Graph nodes & edges
   - Stateful workflows
   - Memory management in LangGraph
   - Error handling & retries

2. **Hands-On Demos**
   - Building simple LangGraphs
   - Integrating with external APIs & tools
   - Multi-agent collaboration flows
   - Checkpointing & persistence

3. **Best Practices**
   - Designing reusable graphs
   - Debugging agent flows
   - Optimizing for efficiency
